TASK 2: Number Guessing Game

This Java program implements a number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within 5 trials. The program prompts the user for guesses and provides feedback on whether the guessed number is greater or less than the target. After each guess, the program informs the user of the remaining trials. 
Upon successful guessing, it displays the number of turns used and the corresponding score. If the user exhausts all trials, it reveals the correct number.
